# Hearing Session

Start a structured Q&A session to gather requirements.

## Process

1. **Create question list** - Identify all questions to ask
2. **Review with user** - Share the question list for additions/removals
3. **Prioritize** - Let user choose the order
4. **One-by-one** - Ask questions sequentially, record answers

## Tips

- Ask specific questions (prefer "A or B?" over "How do you want to do this?")
- Confirm understanding ("So you mean...?")
- "I don't know" or "Decide later" are valid answers
- Break long sessions into multiple parts
